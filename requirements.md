    progress, appointments, and events.
2. **Operational Efficiency** – Simplify workflows for administrators to manage users,
    therapists, and schedules.
3. **Transparency & Communication** – Enable clear, two-way communication between
    parents, therapists, and admins.


4. **Scalability & Security** – Build a system that can grow with future needs while ensuring
    data privacy compliance (GDPR standards).
